"""
Python Indentation(Spaces):-

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

"""

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two")#Indentation
    
#if 5 > 2:
#print("2 is small than 5 ")#Indentation error

"""
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, 
the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

"""

if 1 >2:
    print("5 is greter than 2")
else:
                print("You have an Error")#spaces is up you
                

"""
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, 
otherwise Python will give you an error:

"""

if 10 > 5:
    print("10 is Greater than 5")
#        print("5 is smaller tham 10")#This will give you indentation error
