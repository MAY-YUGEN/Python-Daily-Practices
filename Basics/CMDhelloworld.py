The Python Command Line :-

To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and 
easiest not to write the code in a file. 
This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.

Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line :-

python
or
py
From there you can write any python

Whenever you are done in the python command line, 
you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:

exit()

Command line command 
cls : for clear screen
